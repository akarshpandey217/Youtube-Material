# vTyoob

This project is my naÃ¯ve attempt aimed at making a simple Material version of YouTube using Google APIs, VueJS and Vuetify.
I make this project in my leisure time just to improve my front-end skills.

> You are on `vuetube` branch which is Vue version of this project. This project was originally written using AngularJS and MaterializeCSS and code for the is present in [`ngtube`](https://github.com/pranavjindal999/Youtube-Material/tree/ngtube) branch.

This branch is dev branch for vTyoob. For deployed version, switch to `master`.

Thanks for visiting!
