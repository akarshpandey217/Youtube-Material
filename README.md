# Youtube-Material

> You are viewing the `ngtube` branch of youtube-material. This branch is obsolete and was developed in AngularJS. For latest code, switch to [`vuetube`](https://github.com/pranavjindal999/Youtube-Material/tree/vuetube) branch.

My na√Øve attempt at making a material version of Youtube using materializecss, GoogleApi and AngularJs.

## How to start:

Get node dependencies:
`npm install`
`npm install -g gulp-cli`

For minified build and run:
`gulp build`

For uniminified build with angular debug data:
`gulp`
